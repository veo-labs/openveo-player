# Introduction

OpenVeo player is written using AngularJS and SASS / Compass. SASS files need to be compiled to generate the CSS and JavaScript files can be minified and aggregated for better performance.

# Compiling the OpenVeo Player

You can compile the OpenVeo Player with source maps using the following command:

    grunt dist

You can add the *--production* option to compile without source maps (for production):

    grunt dist --production
