# Introduction

OpenVeo player is written using AngularJS and SASS / Compass. SASS files need to be compiled to generate the CSS and JavaScript files can be minified and aggregated for better performance.

# Compiling the OpenVeo Player

You can compile the OpenVeo Player using the following command:

    npm run build

You can add the *--with-source-maps* option to compile with source maps (for development):

    npm run build -- --with-source-maps
