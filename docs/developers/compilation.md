# Introduction

OpenVeo player is written using AngularJS and SASS / Compass. SASS files need to be compiled to generate the CSS and JavaScript files can be minified and aggregated for better performance.

# Compiling SASS files

You can compile SASS files using the following command:

    grunt compass:dist

Or you can watch SASS files changes using the following command:

    grunt

# Compiling JavaScript files

You'll probably want to compile AngularJS files in production, for better performance. You can do it using:

    grunt dist
